                    Technology is such a pervasive aspect of our lives nowadays. It's amazing to see just what it can do in the fields of 
                    medicine, therapy, communication, and, of course, gaming. Hardware is getting stronger and more complex, processing power 
                    and CPUs are better than ever, and I can't help but marvel at our progress everytime I need a micro SD card. A chip, smaller 
                    than my thumbnail, 128 GB, and less than <i>$20</i>! I doubt someone from 80 years ago could even wrap their head around that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But it continues to change!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Technology is changing so fast it seems hard to keep up sometimes. The next thing is always just around the corner, and we 
                    are forced to adapt to that. So we do. We have to. Because we do, technology doesn't slow down. Because we can adapt to the 
                    rapid-fire needs of the industry, technology can continue to evolve at its breakneck pace.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, keeping up isn't all we do. We innovate, we progress, <i>we</i> advance technology. We're getting closer and closer 
                    to a technologically unified world every day.
